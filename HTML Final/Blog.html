"Its been almost 3 years since the inaugration of the dog shelter took place. Since then the dog shelter has gained a lot of resources in terms of personel, impact in their global goal,etc. It is not only responsible for over 250 dog rescues per year but also responsible for putting the people responsible for the crimes on said dogs behind bars. Its impressive how such small and cute creatures can create such a big impact."

"Being the head sponsorer, it is my responsibilty that there are enough resources or funding for the shelter to run. My job has become easier since the shelter has become self-sufficent due to donations, campaigns, etc. The odg shelter is a non-profit organization hence it devotes all of its funds to the cause. "
