<h1>What is Puppy Power?</h1>

<p> Puppy Power is a non-profit oranisation and we aim to help lost,surrendered or abandoned dogs are house. It was founded in November 2012 by Jai,Soham Joshi,Sophia Keady and Luxin Chen in Co Limerick.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, the number of lost, killed and stray dogs has continued to increase.A lack of shelter for dogs led to increase hugh amount of stray and homeless dog.All of them are in danger and they may hit by car or no food to eat. These dogs all need a home rather than being homeless or wandering. This is an unacceptable thing. Therefore, we decided to organize an organization to give these dogs a warm home for them. We use news raise funds from our site and social media to raise fund,let more people know and help us help these dogs who desire to be loved.</p>
<P>Since 2012, Puppy Power has resued and rehome thousands of dogs in many cases and rehomed them. We spend our lives doing our best caring,training,rehabiliating and also looking for a best homes for them. We couldn't do it without all of you who support us and with warm hearth to try to help as much as you can.</p>
